### Support the Project

If you or your employer is commercially dependent on Phoenix (or a previous incarnation), please help to sponsor continual forward movement in the code-base. Phoenix needs you as much as you need Phoenix! I am hopeful that all shopowners, developers, consultants and businesses will support the Project ... allowing two professional developers to work on the code on an ad-hoc basis. 

A Supporter's subscription includes access to the current season of Supporters code as seen at the Supporters Demo shop; https://template.me.uk/supporters/index.php
