# Thank You

To all shopowners, developers, consultants and business owners who have supported the project over the years.

## Beer Tokens

"Beer Tokens" are not used to purchase beer - they are used to give time into the Project.  I am hopeful that enough shopowners, developers, consultants and businesses ... will join the Phoenix Club to allow two professional developers to work on the code on an ad-hoc basis.
