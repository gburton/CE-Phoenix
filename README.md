Help to move the Project forward

I need your help to move this Project forward.  At the moment, this project is done on my own, as and when time can be given.  
To allow me to give more time to this Project, I need your support;

- give time for testing new code and/or getting involved in discussions
- give code to the project - create a github account, fork and start coding

If you cannot give time or code, please give a Pledgie.  Simply click on the Donate button below to donate via Paypal...

Minimum PHP Version
===================

5.3

If you are on an older PHP version, you may find errors.  Update your PHP version.

Looking for Loaded?
===================

This will never become a "loaded" osCommerce.  So if you are looking for something with a lot of addons pre-installed, this is not for you.  
We are striving to make the front end 100% modular, so good add-on makers can create modules which are simple to (un)install, changing no core code.



Demo Site
=========

Check out the demo site at http://template.me.uk/2334bs3/ - please note that this might be slightly behind "Edge", or might have modules that are about to be added to "Edge".  More or less, this is how Responsive osCommerce looks out of the box.


Installation
============

Install as if this is a new osCommerce installation.
You can now play with the Modular aspect we've introduced.

Admin > Modules > Header Tags > {install}
Admin > Modules > Boxes > {install}
Admin > Modules > Content > {install}
Admin > Modules > Navbar Modules > {install} 

All of these can be sorted using the sort order, lowest is displayed first.

Database Conversion Script
==========================

To go from an older osCommerce to this one, this Script might help:
